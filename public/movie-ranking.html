<h1>The Best Movies According to Gixi</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Your Name</h3>
<p>This is my favorite anime movie. This movie not only has one of the best story line <br />
but animation and plotting is also quiet good.</p>
<h3>Sarbjit</h3>
<p>This is the best bollywood movie made on a story of a real person. This is the only movie <br />
i haven't ranked based on story line but rather the acting of the main protagonist Randeep Hooda <br />
which played the character so freaking well that it made tears fall off my eyes. This might be the <br />
only movie i have cried out loud to</p>
<h3>One Piece Stampede</h3>
<p>I would rank it on the top when it comes to non canon one piece movies.<br />
But among all the movies this is my third favorite</p>
